# 💉 Vaccination Data Analysis & Visualization

A public health analytics project focused on understanding global vaccination trends, disease incidence, and the impact of vaccine introduction using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Analyze global vaccination datasets to:
- Track vaccination coverage across countries and time.
- Examine disease incidence trends.
- Correlate vaccination efforts with disease reduction.
- Support public health strategies and policy decisions using interactive visualizations.

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Python for data cleaning and processing  
- SQL for relational database design and management  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Power BI for interactive data visualization  
- Healthcare and public health domain understanding

---

## 📊 Business Use Cases

- **Public Health Strategy**: Prioritize regions with low coverage.
- **Disease Prevention**: Evaluate vaccine effectiveness.
- **Resource Allocation**: Target vaccine distribution where it's needed most.
- **Global Health Policy**: Track progress toward WHO targets (e.g., 95% measles coverage by 2030).

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The project uses five cleaned CSV files:

| Table Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `coverage_data` | Vaccination rates by antigen, country, and year |
| `incidence_rate_data` | Disease incidence rates per population |
| `reported_cases_data` | Raw disease case counts |
| `vaccine_introduction_data` | Vaccine introduction status by country |
| `vaccine_schedule_data` | Dosing schedule and target populations |
